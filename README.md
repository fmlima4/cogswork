# cogswork test

First I would like to thank you for the opportunity to show a little of what I know, 

I believe I came close to delivering this test in its entirety, I could even finish everything that was requested but I didn't want to put much more time on it so it wouldn't be too different from the others candidates since the stipulated time is 2h. As I have only been working with PHP for a few months, I needed to remember some details, but I arrive at the end happy with what I managed to produce, 

I hope we can move forward with the application, I believe I can add a lot to cogworks, maybe it's not the ultra senior developer but I trust you have the skills to understand a problem and find a valuable solution to it. For the hour, 

that's it, I'm available.

# how i have structured my steps to solve the tests:
    - understand the problem 20min -
    - think about how to organize the components 20min
    - create their front, put them on the screen 20min
    - create a minimum style 1h
    - move to the features themselves 2h
    - refactor and improve code 1h
    - unit tests 1h


# plus features for the future:
    - better alert menssages when error
    - finish unit and integrations tests
    - use the geo-reference from user browser to save his location
    - edit and delete shifts
    - privileges by users
    - light and dark mode
    - format the seconds counter to show day hours and minutes
    - offline operation
    - show the duration of shift in shift history table
